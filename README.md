# portfolio
A collection of code I have written.

Hello and welcome to my little portfolio. 

Most of these files are from college courses, some of which were group projects. Space Invaders was a two-person project and the Book Store was a four-person project. I am working on adding some code written from problem-solving on sites like LeetCode to show a glimpse of how I code now. These will be in C#, which is my primary coding language.

Thank you for visiting! :)
